Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1250000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1250000000 samples is 271.58, and randomly
would exceed this value 22.72 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5002 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141492600 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000035 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
