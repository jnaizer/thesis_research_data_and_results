Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1250000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1250000000 samples is 261.28, and randomly
would exceed this value 38.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4993 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141515333 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000007 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
